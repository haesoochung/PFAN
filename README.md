> **Abstract:** *Multi-exposure high dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to generate an HDR image from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images. There are two main challenges in this task; camera and object
motions causing ghost artifacts and over/under-exposure areas having no information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a deep neural network that aligns the multiple inputs through feature transformation
and hallucinates the washed-out areas after fusion. Specifically, we propose a pyramidal feature adjustment network (PFAN) that adjusts the reference image featuresâ€™ brightness and structure with respect to LDR
inputs and regard them as the aligned features of the LDR inputs. Then, the features from the PFANs are integrated in a coarse-to-fine manner. They are first merged into an HDR image in a fusion network, and
the washed-out regions are restored using valid information in a hallucination network. To deal with larger displacements in motion alignment, we also present a progressive training strategy, which begins the training
with easy samples having little motion and then transfers the network with more dynamic samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.*

## Overview
![framework](https://github.com/haesoochung/PFAN/assets/92298918/9a4763ae-32cc-4dca-988c-487b6ee19cc8)

## Dependencies

* Tesorflow 
* OpenCV

## Training
1. Download Kalantari dataset from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/SIG17HDR/.
2. Make tfrecords
```
python utils/make_tfrecords.py
```
3. Download the [pre-trained vgg16 model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Pp-ZBzrGxgIh5VlyBWZcRly8QT5ZhnG/view?usp=sharing) in the "utils" folder.
4. Train
```
python main.py --mode train
```
## Test
1. Make a folder named checkpoints and download the [pre-trained model weight](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g_aOOHLm204uQPz4pVj1WbD8Fg47bcrc?usp=share_link).
```
mkdir checkpoints
cd checkpoints
```
2. Test
```
python main.py --mode test 
```
